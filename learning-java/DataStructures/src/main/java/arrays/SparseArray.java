/**
 * SparseArrays map integers to Objects.  Unlike a normal array of Objects,
 * there can be gaps in the indices.  It is intended to be more memory efficient
 * than using a HashMap to map Integers to Objects, both because it avoids
 * auto-boxing keys and its data structure doesn't rely on an extra entry object
 * for each mapping.
 *
 * <p>Note that this container keeps its mappings in an array data structure,
 * using a binary search to find keys.  The implementation is not intended to be appropriate for
 * data structures
 * that may contain large numbers of items.  It is generally slower than a traditional
 * HashMap, since lookups require a binary search and adds and removes require inserting
 * and deleting entries in the array.  For containers holding up to hundreds of items,
 * the performance difference is not significant, less than 50%.</p>
 *
 * <p>To help with performance, the container includes an optimization when removing
 * keys: instead of compacting its array immediately, it leaves the removed entry marked
 * as deleted.  The entry can then be re-used for the same key, or compacted later in
 * a single garbage collection step of all removed entries.  This garbage collection will
 * need to be performed at any time the array needs to be grown or the the map size or
 * entry values are retrieved.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is possible to iterate over the items in this container using
 * {@link #keyAt(int)} and {@link #valueAt(int)}. Iterating over the keys using
 * <code>keyAt(int)</code> with ascending values of the index will return the
 * keys in ascending order, or the values corresponding to the keys in ascending
 * order in the case of <code>valueAt(int)</code>.</p>
