 * Learning
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 *
 * Write a program to find the nth super ugly number.
 * Super ugly numbers are positive numbers whose all prime factors
 * are in the given prime list primes of size k.
 *
 * For example, [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32] is the sequence of
 * the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2, 7, 13, 19] of size 4.
 *
 * Note :
 * (1) 1 is a super ugly number for any given primes.
 * (2) The given numbers in primes are in ascending order.
 * (3) 0 < k ≤ 100, 0 < n ≤ 106, 0 < primes[i] < 1000.
 * (4) The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
