## Arrays

- Arrays are the most basic type of data structure that stores similar kind of values. 
- Each item in an array is an element and can be accessed using an index. 
    - Normally arrays have 0 based index which means indexing starts from 0 and goes till _n - 1_ where n is the number of elements in an array.
    - Arrays can have 0 based indexing, 1 based indexing or n based indexing (for negative values)
- Size of an array is fixed at runtime when initialized. It can't be changed after initialization.
- If the size has to be changed after initialization, use _ArrayList_ (Collection class) instead.
- Size of an array can be specified using int only since arrays are int based index.
- The ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown when a non-existing index of an array is being accessed.
- Arrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables. 
- Many databases, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.
- Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, strings, and VLists.
- Below is the representation,

**Defining Arrays**
- Java offers several ways of defining and initializing arrays, including literal and constructor notations. When declaring arrays without explicit values, each element will be initialized with a default value:
    - **0** for primitive numerical types: _byte, short, char, int, long, float, and double._
    - **false** for the _boolean_ type.
    - **null** for _reference_ types.

In Java, it is possible to have arrays of size 0:
```java 
int[] array = new int[0]; // Compiles and runs fine.
```
However, since it's an empty array, no elements can be assigned to it:
```java
array[0] = 1; // Throws java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
```
Such empty arrays are typically used as return values so that the calling code only has to worry about dealing with an array, rather than a potentially null value that may lead to a NullPointerException.
The length of an array must be a non-negative integer:
```java
int[] array = new int[-1]; // Throws java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException
```
The array size can be determined using a public final field called length:
```java
System.out.println(array.length); // Prints 0 in this case.
```
**Note:** _array.length_ returns the actual size of the array and not the number of array elements which were assigned a value, unlike ArrayList#size() which returns the number of array elements which were assigned a value.
**************************************

**Syntax**
```java
ArrayType[] variableName; // Declaring arrays
ArrayType variableName[]; // Another valid syntax (less commonly used)
ArrayType[][][] variableName; // Declaring multi-dimensional jagged arrays (repeat []s)
ArrayType myVar = array[index]; // Accessing (reading) element at index
array[index] = value; // Assign value to position index of array
ArrayType[] myArray = new ArrayType[arrayLength]; // Array initialization syntax
int[] ints = {1, 2, 3}; // Array initialization syntax with values provided, length is inferred from the number of provided values: {[value1[, value2]*]}
new int[]{4, -5, 6} // Can be used as argument, without a local variable
int[] ints = new int[3]; // same as {0, 0, 0}
int[][] ints = {{1, 2}, {3}, null}; // Multi-dimensional array initialization. int[] extends Object (and so does anyType[]) so null is a valid value.
```
**************************************

**Multi Dimensional Arrays**  
```java
int[][] a = new int[3][4]; // Creates a matrix with 3 rows and 4 columns
```
Below is the representation of multi dimensional array

There are two orders that can exist in a multidimensional array, i.e  
_Row major_ and _Column major_  
ex, consider below matrix

<img width="185" alt="arrays-3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3439029/32186517-7c5991ba-bd5f-11e7-9c82-f369b3590492.png">

Here, in row-major layout, elements can be represented as **[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]** whereas in column-major layout, elements can be represented as **[1,4,7,2,5,8,3,6,9]**

**************************************

**Creating and initializing generic type arrays**  

In generic classes, arrays of generic types cannot be initiated like so due to type erasure:
```java
public class MyGenericClass<T> {
    private T[] a;

    public MyGenericClass() {
        a = new T[5]; // Compile time error: generic array creation
    }
}
```
Instead, they can be created using one of the following methods:  

**1.** By creating an Object array, and casting it to the generic type:
```java
a = (T[])new Object[5];
```
This is the simplest method, but since the underlying array is still of type Object[], this method does not provide type safety, so the array is best used only within the generic class, not exposed publicly.  

**2.** By using Array.newInstance with a class parameter:
```java
public MyGenericClass(Class<T> clazz) {
    a = (T[]) Array.newInstance(clazz, 5);
}
```
Here the class of T has to be explicitly passed to the constructor. The return type of Array.newInstance is always Object. However, the newly created array is in fact of type T[], and can be safely externalized.
**************************************

**Sorted Arrays**  

Arrays are considered to be sorted in ascending order when each element on the left of that element in an array is smaller than that element itself. Vice versa goes for descending order.

**Pros:**
- Accessing an element is fast using the index - access time is O(1).
- Much faster to process - see this question.  
    
**Cons:**
- Insertion and deletion are slow, subsequent elements must be moved - complexity for insertion, in that case is O(n).
- A large enough block of memory is needed to hold the array.
- Easily corrupted (data could be inserted in the middle).  

**************************************

**Arrays v/s List**

| **Property**        | **Array**           | **List**  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| **Size** | _Fixed length. Cannot change the size after creation_ | _Dynamic in size. Capacity grows as the elements are added_ |
| **Content** | _Can contain primitive data types and objects_ | _Objects only. No primitive data types_ |
| **Dimension** | _Can be multi-dimensional_ | _Normally single dimensional, but can be made multi dimensional_ |
| **Type Safety** | _Typesafe, meaning that array will contain objects of specific class or primitives of specific data type_ | _Not type-safe by default. Generics can be used to make a List type safe_ |
| **Insertion/Deletion** | _Shifting existing elements may be needed if action is performed not at the end of the array_ | _Easy insertion/deletion methods provided_ |
**************************************

**Disadvantages of Arrays**
- **Fixed Size**: The size of the array is static, i.e we define the size when we create the array, which can't change later on.
- **One block allocation**: To allocate the array, in the beginning, we may not have enough memory to hold entire array because of continuous block of allocation.
- **Complex position based insertion**: This is applicable only in case of dynamic array or list, where size can change. If we want to insert an element at position n, we have to shift all the elements to the right by one position to make space for this new element, which is a time consuming and costly operation.

**Operations on Arrays** 

Below operations on Arrays are implemented [here](../Arrays/BasicOperations.java)
