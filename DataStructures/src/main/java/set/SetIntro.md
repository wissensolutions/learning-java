## Set

A data structure that can store values in any random order and does not contain duplicates. 
Set contains a finite number of elements. Set can be implemented using Arrays, LinkedList, 
Vectors and HashTables. Insert operation in Set makes sure that no duplicate exists in the Set.
There are 2 types of Sets, 

- Static
    - Static set cannot change the elements after constructing the Set.
    - Operations supported are for build and iteration of elements. 
- Dynamic   
    - Dynamic set can change the elements after construction.
    - Operations supported are addition and removal as well along with static set operations.
