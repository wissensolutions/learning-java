## Queue Introduction

A queue is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle. An excellent example of a queue is a line of students in the food court. New additions to a line are made to the back of the queue, while removal (or serving) happens in the front. In the queue only two operations are allowed enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue means to insert an item into the back of the queue, dequeue means removing the front item. 
The picture demonstrates the FIFO access.

The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

There are various applications of Queue :

Queue, as the name suggests is used whenever we need to have any group of objects in an order in which the first one coming in, also gets out first while the others wait for there turn, like in the following scenarios,
- Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer, CPU task scheduling etc.
- In real life, Call Center phone systems will use Queues, to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative is free.
- Handling of interrupts in real-time systems. The interrupts are handled in the same order as they arrive, First come first served.
